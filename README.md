# Top Tracks
Since this app is still in development mode, Spotify requires me to add users to an allowlist in order to successfully make the API requests. If you're interested in trying it out, feel free to email me at sophiali99723@gmail.com so I can add you to the list!

This web app allows users to get their top tracks on Spotify. According to Spotify's [documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-users-top-artists-and-tracks), top tracks are based on calculated affinity. Users can choose the time period and the number of tracks they would like to see. Additionally, users can listen to a preview of each track.

Moreover, users have the ability to create a new playlist of their top tracks.

I added a bonus feature where users can change the theme of the page, and each theme is inspired by one of Taylor Swift's album covers. Try clicking "Taylor Swift Version" to get your top tracks from Taylor.
