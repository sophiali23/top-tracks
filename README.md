# Top Tracks
Try it [here](https://sophiali23.github.io/top-tracks)!

This web app allows users to get their top tracks on Spotify. According to Spotify's [documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-users-top-artists-and-tracks), top tracks are based on calculated affinity. Users can choose the time period and the number of tracks they would like to see. Additionally, users can listen to a preview of each track.

Users also have the ability to create a new playlist of their top tracks.

I added a bonus feature where users can change the theme of the page, and each theme is inspired by one of Taylor Swift's album covers. Try clicking "Taylor Swift Version" to get your top tracks from Taylor.
